#+TITLE: 13 August 2022 - 19 August 2022

* MIT OCW
** 18.02 - Multiple Variable Calculus
*** Session 78, PS10
* Emergency Crystal Radio
** Fixed switch by removing broken wafer (1 of 2)
* Mill Controller #2
** Repurpose 'boss' hard drive
** Need to investigate new HW/SW for eventual replacements
*** Old crap ain't gonna last forever
*** Buildroot/Linux 5.15 PREEMPT + latency tools
First pass done - boots on real hardware
* Alum Rock Data Center
** Using CentOS 7 for now - good until 2024?
** need to check alma, rocky, others? for suitability
* OLPC
** Needs ML1120 coin batteries to fix "invalid system date".
* Virtual Orchestra
** sfz file tests
*** need tooling to edit sample files
** increasingly skeptical whether quality results are possible
* gat
** spectrogram done - matches 'octave' output
* abby
** installed three wire chassis fan - too noisy
** need to get 4 wire chassis fan
* marble computing
** Purely mechanical linkage likely too complex for most circuits
*** Difficult to generalize
*** Complexity grows with product of bits and stages
*** Not sure how to 'AND' inputs efficiently
*** Tofolli -> CNOT expansion increases complexity
** Electromechanical linkage likely workable
*** Easily generalizable
*** 'Rocker' staging/sequencing allows infinite stages
*** Complexity grows with bits only
*** RC servos for CNOT gate control relatively inexpensive
* More project ideas
** Zuse Z3 simulation in Verilog
   Good excuse for floating point ALU design.
** GMPForth ports to SIMH
*** SIMH maybe some targets (vax)
*** MAME looks interesting for microprocessor system emulations
    How to support erzatz systems?
*** Ports to classic figFORTH targets
** GMPASM assembler
   May be useful for handbuilt and rare systems (DMX1000?).
** Extracting ISO Superboard Forth ROMS for MAME emulation
** 'bwocl' OpenCL tooling
*** Offline compilation
*** Standard Kernel Running
** hardware support for classic 5V CPUs
*** RTX2000, CDP1802 still in production!
*** 6502, 68000, 320C30, others on hand
*** CPUs with async bus may be supportable without RAM
*** Use Nucleo w/ 5V tolerant IO as boot loader controller
** Existing 'retro' hardware still working?
*** OSI Superboard
*** Super Jolt
*** Ampro Little Board
*** Etc.
* David Davies
** Broadcom BCG? Employee indicted for running a brothel.
** New case C1923172, consolidated with *15* Parties.
** Next hearing 9/6/2022
* Peter Kim
** Broadcom CSG Employee indicted for trade secret theft.
** United States v. Kim (5:21-cr-00438).
** Change of Plea Hearing Held 5/10/2022 (Guilty on various counts)
** Sentencing 9/20/2022
