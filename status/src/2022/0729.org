#+TITLE: 23 July 2022 - 29 July 2022

* MIT OCW
** 18.02 - Multiple Variable Calculus
*** PS9 con't.
* Emergency Crystal Radio
** Broke inductor selector - oops. Fix/replace?
* Mill Controller #2
** Try Alpine Linux
** Need to investigate new HW/SW for eventual replacements
*** Old crap ain't gonna last forever
*** Buildroot/Linux 5.15 PREEMPT + latency tools
First pass done - boots on real hardware
* Alum Rock Data Center
** Using CentOS 7 for now - good until 2024?
** need to check alma, rocky, others? for suitability
* OLPC
** Needs ML1120 coin batteries to fix "invalid system date".
* Virtual Orchestra
** sfz file tests
*** Started new audio tool program to replace aftools
* i5 system
** delicate primes
*** Verified 294001 is a delicate prime in base 10
*** Determined 294001 is delicate in bases 2 and 10 but not in bases 3-9,11-16
*** What is the smallest delicate prime N in *any* base 2..(N-1)?
    Does this question even make sense?
** i5-12600K CPU
** 32GB DDR5 mem
** 512GB SSD
** AMD Radeon RX 6800 GPU
** ~100 compute cores across all devices
   Hopefully won't have to do this again for a while. This blows the
   toy budget for the year.
* More project ideas
** Zuse Z3 simulation in Verilog
   Good excuse for floating point ALU design.
** ENIAC simulation in verilog
   Probably too big a nut to chew.
** GMPForth ports to SIMH, DYCyber targets
*** SIMH maybe some targets (vax)
*** DTCyber suboptimal due to data/addr word size mismatch
*** MAME looks interesting for microprocessor system emulations
    How to support erzatz systems?
*** Ports to classic figFORTH targets
** GMPASM assembler
   May be useful for handbuilt systems.
* David Davies
** Broadcom BCG? Employee indicted for running a brothel.
** New case C1923172, consolidated with *15* Parties.
** Next hearing 9/6/2022
* Peter Kim
** Broadcom CSG Employee indicted for trade secret theft.
** United States v. Kim (5:21-cr-00438).
** Change of Plea Hearing Held 5/10/2022 (Guilty on various counts)
** Sentencing 9/20/2022
