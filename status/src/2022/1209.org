#+TITLE: 02 December 2022 - 09 December 2022

* MIT OCW
** Done for the year.
* Mill Controller #2
** Mounted on display enclosure
** Need to investigate new HW/SW for eventual replacements
*** Old crap ain't gonna last forever
*** Buildroot/Linux 5.15 PREEMPT + latency tools
First pass done - boots on real hardware
* Alum Rock Data Center
** need to check rocky, others? (arch?) for suitability
** recheck ALMA, now that CERN and Fermilab are using it
* OLPC
** Trish's OLPC battery fixed and OS updated.
* Virtual Orchestra
** sfz file tests
*** need tooling to edit sample files
** increasingly skeptical whether quality results are possible
** maybe should treat as platform for concatinative synthesis
** maybe should just accept the limitations and work with it
One should not be disappointed that a guitar can't sound like a flute.
* gat
** spectrogram done - matches 'octave' output
* RIOT drivers
Implemented - needs testing.
** WS2801
** Velleman KA03
** Velleman KA05
* mcd05 32 button/led box
** Recovered schematics.
** Planning software.
** Received STM32F767 Nucleo144 with Ethernet.
*** Test program running.
*** Need to consider CoAP multicast discovery.
*** Consider simpler architecture with STM32F767 as a 'hub'.
* AMD 2900 bitslice computing
** Probably my oldest uncompleted project
** Exploring possibilities for something constructive
Create verilog models for 2903/2910 and verify against hardware?
* Hitachi HD68B09E CPU
** RAM/UART/IO
Maybe have a standard peripheral set for 8 bit CPU bringups
** Arduino Mega 2560 DMA loader
...Along with standard 8 bit loader
** Generate quadrature clock directly
** Full Bus SW Emulation infeasable
6809 1000ns maximum cycle time too short
* PLD programming
Looks like Atmel 16V8 is the last 5V PLD part left standing. Maybe not
surprising that there still doesn't appear to be a fully open source
tool chain for programming. How hard could it be? (!) Could next-pnr
generic help? Might be easier to use espresso for logic array and program
output logic bits directly for simple stuff.
* More project ideas
** Zuse Z3 simulation in Verilog
   Good excuse for floating point ALU design.
** GMPForth ports to simulators
*** SIMH for some targets (vax)
*** MAME looks interesting for microprocessor system emulations
    How to support erzatz systems?
*** Ports to classic figFORTH targets
** GMPASM assembler
   May be useful for handbuilt and rare systems (DMX1000?).
** Extracting ISO Superboard Forth ROMS for MAME emulation
** 'bwocl' OpenCL tooling
*** Offline compilation
*** Standard Kernel Running
** hardware support for classic 5V CPUs
*** RTX2000, CDP1802 still available!
*** 6502, 68000, 320C30, others on hand
*** CPUs with totally async bus may be supportable without RAM
*** Use 5V Atmel CPU as boot loader controller
*** Could use small foorprint monitor in asm (gmpmon?)
*** Started planning for HD68B09E.
** Existing 'retro' hardware still working?
*** OSI Superboard
Unknown. Composite to VGA adapter didn't seem to work. Needs analysis.
Found OSI model 610 board underneath!
*** Super Jolt
No output. Needs analysis.
*** Ampro Little Board
Not booting. Needs analysis.
*** Rockwell R65F11 Demo board
UART sending "NO ROM" at 2400 7N1 as expected with 2MHz xtal.
*** NMIX-0016
Works. Found original prom in a parts stash(!).
* David Davies
** Broadcom BCG? Employee indicted for running a brothel.
** New case C1923172, consolidated with *15* Parties.
** Next hearing 12/15/2022
