   Awful, unless you *wanted* the bass clarinets to sound like farts.

* Audio Distribution
  Distributing audio in SCZ from office to family room. Using icecast as
  server and a raspberry pi zero W as client (with mplayer). Most fiddly
  part was feeding icecast with audio via 'jack'. After trying numerous
  approaches (mixxx, butt, ezstream, vlc); settled on vlc. RPi still needs
  some sort of screensaver that doesn't kill audio.
