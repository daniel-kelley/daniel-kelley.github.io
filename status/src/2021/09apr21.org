Got Frustration?

* Santa Cruz Weather Station
  Mast sensors still broken
* EPICS
  no progress
* Brini Tracker II
  Buttons still work after twelve weeks week of runtime. GPS display
  update seems to be intermittent but is not working at this moment.
* wktcolor
  Use wktlib (from wktplot); wkt header needs c++ guard. Need a
  strategy to make unique vertices fro constructing faces.
* ca-r
  data file has returned, quality unknown. The data description page
  indicates that there are known problems.
* AMDGPU
  Started looking at AMD GPU programming after a five year
  hiatus. Still trying to get a working openmp toolchain. Updated
  kmtrun which now compiles, but it fails at runtime to initialize a
  work queue.  Tried building tools with GCC, LLVM/Clang, AMD AOMP,
  and using AMD RPMs directly, and all show major problems of one sort
  or another. Frustrating. Is this why NVidia is ahead GPU-wise?
