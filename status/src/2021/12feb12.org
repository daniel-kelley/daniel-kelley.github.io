I Apparently Am An Unthinking Person

* Santa Cruz Weather Station
Mast sensors still broken
* EPICS

Created u3s threaded synchronous U3 API library. ASAN,TSAN clean and
with ruby FFI interface.

Refactored u3a library data interfaces and feedback APIs to facilitate
u3s.  Fixed shared library naming and linking problems; improved
sanitizer Makefile interface.

Reworked u3hv-scpi to use u3s.

* Brini Tracker II
Buttons still work after four weeks week of runtime. GPS display update
seems to be intermittent as it is not working at this moment.
