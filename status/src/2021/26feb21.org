Perseverance takes a look around

* Santa Cruz Weather Station
Mast sensors still broken
* EPICS

Established unit test methodology
Started digital output

* Brini Tracker II
Buttons still work after six weeks week of runtime. GPS display update
seems to be intermittent as it is not working at this moment.

* WKT to SVG converter

basically libgeos to libplot

WKT may be well known but perhaps not consistently implemented as
libgeos could only parse a few of the "*.wkt" files laying around.

Works well enough for my purposes.

* Perseverance mapping

Started planning on mapping Perseverance EDL Mars surface images from
the JPL EDL video on to a Mars surface map. Looks like GRASS GIS is
the way to go, which is great because I am already somewhat familiar
with it - although it sure has gotten fancier in the years since I
looked at it last.
