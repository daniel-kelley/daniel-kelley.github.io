Summertime! and the mornings are mostly overcast

* Santa Cruz Weather Station

  Particle Monitor shelter assemblies checked.

** Next step
*** Finish remaining part designs
*** Update schematic
    Cable assemblies
*** Print parts
*** Order any needed supplies
    DB9 shells, jack screws, connectors, etc.
*** Assemble and test

* Gluing press
  Made small gluing press
* Swocer
  Looked into what is needed to support screw thread generation.
  Bunch of work...
** Next steps
   Plan that bunch of work.
   Check out what's needed for gears.

* Linux Audio

** Faust programming
*** Analog Synthesizer modules
    Waveshaper, Frequency Shifter, Karplus-Strong Plucked String
** Next Steps
*** GAC Patch save/restore
*** LV2 autopatcher
    Exploratory tool to generate (was pd, ecasound, now carla) patch for arbitrary LV2 plugin:
    hook up audio inputs to signal source, audio outputs to speakers, control inputs to
    control surface, etc.
*** OSC control surface
    Some sort of GUI tool (knob/slider) to OSC messages. This may be
    as simple as a Faust UI program.
*** Faust/csound
    See if a faust generated unit works.
* EPICS
**  Next steps
*** u3scpi network port testing
*** initial EPICS interface
*** u3scpi analog/digital port reconfiguration.

* Brini Tracker II
Still working!
** Next steps
*** Validate remaining standard GPS messages
*** Investigate GPS chipset data logging
*** Investigate LoRA radio interface

* wktcolor
** Next steps
*** Explore how to get a minimal coloring
    Need a specific planar graph four coloring.

* wktplot
** Next steps
   Understand why -r doesn't solve the wktvor/wktdel "sliver at edge" problem.
   Explore biological cell Voronoi organization

* ca-r
** Next Step
None, but expecting ca-tier to break now that the tier system is
deprecated. Looks like thet just stopped updating the data file.

* AMDGPU
** Next step
*** Reverse engineer HSAKMT programming.

* Ninja v Make
** Next Step
*** clean simple measurements

* GMP Forth
  Need to think about adding floating point support
