#+TITLE: 25 September 2021 - 01 October 2021

October already?

* MIT OCW
** 18.01 - Single Variable Calculus
*** Sessions 29-31
** 8.01 - Physics I - Classical Mechanics
*** Sessions 13-17
* Marble Computation
  Collected materials (thin copper plate, copper PCB blanks) for prototyping.
** Next Steps
*** Continue Reversible Computation Study
*** Prototype Marble inverter
    Using dual rail differential logic (left/,right/1), an inverter
    merely switches sides. I think little "kickers" on the side should
    be sufficient for a purely mechanical approach.
* ca-r
  https://github.com/daniel-kelley/ca-r/issues/29
** Next Step
None.
* us-index-map
** error analysis
   Started an error analysis on the USGS topomaps_all.csv index file. Nothing abvious pops up,
   and the error reported by Maureen would be impossible to catch anyway.
* Sun Ultra 10
  Trying to see what state it is in. Fires up but no video. Need DB25M to
  debug over serial port.
** Next steps
*** Serial debug
* Apple iMac G4
  Building userland may be a PITA due to lack of RAM. Build would often
  segfault.
** Next steps
Not sure.

* Davies Brothel
  Next (plea) hearing: 28 October; Department 37
* Linux Audio
** pvanal to spectrogram
   Enough of libriffr and libpvocf work to start pvoctool
   https://github.com/daniel-kelley/pvoctool. Have HDF5 output and
   text delimited output for octave. Can import PVOC data to octave
   spectrogram for display.
*** Next steps
   Loop analysis
** CSound programming.
   The FORTRAN of computer music. Getting up to speed.
*** Next Steps
**** loscil demo
**** spectrogram loop point analysis
** Faust programming
*** Next Steps
**** GAC Patch save/restore
**** LV2 autopatcher
    Exploratory tool to generate (was pd, ecasound, now carla) patch for arbitrary LV2 plugin:
    hook up audio inputs to signal source, audio outputs to speakers, control inputs to
    control surface, etc.
**** OSC control surface
    Some sort of GUI tool (knob/slider) to OSC messages. This may be
    as simple as a Faust UI program.
**** Faust/csound
    See if a faust generated unit works.
* EPICS
**  Next steps
*** u3scpi network port testing
*** initial EPICS interface
*** u3scpi analog/digital port reconfiguration.

* Brini Tracker II
Suspended for now.
** Next steps
*** Validate remaining standard GPS messages
*** Investigate GPS chipset data logging
*** Investigate LoRA radio interface

* wktcolor
** Next steps
*** Explore how to get a minimal coloring
    Need a specific planar graph four coloring.

* wktplot
** Next steps
   Understand why -r doesn't solve the wktvor/wktdel "sliver at edge" problem.
   Explore biological cell Voronoi organization

* AMDGPU
** Next step
*** Reverse engineer HSAKMT programming.

* Ninja v Make
** Next Step
*** clean simple measurements

* GMP Forth
** Need to think about adding floating point support
** Port to non-Linux OS
* Swocer
** Most crashing addressed
   Nullified 'handle' API free functions helped a lot.
   Still see some errors in operations.
** Added outline for 'bottle' test
   Added all functions believed to be needed for 'bottle' demo test.
   Test doesn't pass so is disabled.
** Next steps
   Swocer future.
   Check out what's needed for gears.
