Quiet Forth of July

* Santa Cruz Weather Station

  Most Particle Monitor shelter parts fabricated.

  | Part                 | Quan. | Designed? | Fabricated? |
  |----------------------+-------+-----------+-------------|
  | Vent connector mount |     1 | *         | *           |
  | Vent connector cover |     1 | *         | *           |
  | Vent mount           |     2 |           |             |
  | PM box               |     1 | *         | *           |
  | PM lid               |     1 | *         | *           |
  | PM Baffle            |     1 | *         | *           |
  | PM Screen mount      |     2 | *         | *           |
  | PM Screen holder     |     2 | *         | *           |
  | PM Inlet shroud      |     1 | *         | *           |
  | PM box mount         |     1 |           |             |
  | Vent/UV mount        |     1 |           |             |
  | PM Cable assembly    |     1 |           | (1)         |
  | UV Cable assembly    |     1 |           |             |

  (1) Likely will just reuse previous assembly

** Next step
*** Order any needed supplies
    Screws. Need to establish a better source of hardware as existing
    sources have finally dried up. I'm not paying $0.50 each for a
    #4x1/4" sheet metal screw.

*** Assemble and test

* Swocer
** Most crashing addressed
   Nullified 'handle' API free functions helped a lot.
   Still see some errors in operations.
** Added outline for 'bottle' test
   Added all functions believed to be needed for 'bottle' demo test.
   Test doesn't pass so is disabled.
** Next steps
   Swocer future.
   Check out what's needed for gears.
* Soap Molds
  Investigating mold making for hand soaps (for Annie).
  Need to implement 'drafts' in swocer if I go that route.
* ca-r
  Tier data finally deprecated so processing is removed.
** Next Step
None.

* Linux Audio
** CSound programming.
   The FORTRAN of computer music. Getting up to speed.
*** Next Steps
**** loscil demo
**** pvanal to spectrogram
**** spectrogram loop point analysis
** Faust programming
*** Next Steps
**** GAC Patch save/restore
**** LV2 autopatcher
    Exploratory tool to generate (was pd, ecasound, now carla) patch for arbitrary LV2 plugin:
    hook up audio inputs to signal source, audio outputs to speakers, control inputs to
    control surface, etc.
**** OSC control surface
    Some sort of GUI tool (knob/slider) to OSC messages. This may be
    as simple as a Faust UI program.
**** Faust/csound
    See if a faust generated unit works.
* EPICS
**  Next steps
*** u3scpi network port testing
*** initial EPICS interface
*** u3scpi analog/digital port reconfiguration.

* Brini Tracker II
Suspended for now.
** Next steps
*** Validate remaining standard GPS messages
*** Investigate GPS chipset data logging
*** Investigate LoRA radio interface

* wktcolor
** Next steps
*** Explore how to get a minimal coloring
    Need a specific planar graph four coloring.

* wktplot
** Next steps
   Understand why -r doesn't solve the wktvor/wktdel "sliver at edge" problem.
   Explore biological cell Voronoi organization

* AMDGPU
** Next step
*** Reverse engineer HSAKMT programming.

* Ninja v Make
** Next Step
*** clean simple measurements

* GMP Forth
  Need to think about adding floating point support
