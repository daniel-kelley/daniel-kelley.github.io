Sedition fallout

* Abstract schematic symbols

Started. Seems to more-or-less work, but the OR symbols aren't perfect.

The math for the OR symbols seems to be sorted out, but took longer
than expected.

* EPICS

** U3-HV input configuration abstract schematic

* Brini Tracker II
Seems to have hung up as the display is no longer responsive.

* Dodecahedron
Worked out a 4-coloring. How to do this programmatically? How many
distinct 4-colorings are there?

* ca-r

Want to add tier data. Likely to be a PITA because the data file
location changes when updated.

* GEOS

Started studying the GOES 2D geometry API.

* Books
Finished a couple of classics from my library:
** A Mathematician Reads The Newspaper
