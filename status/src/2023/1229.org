#+TITLE: 23 December 2023 - 29 December 2023

Another Year Gone!

* MIT OCW
** 18.03sc (differential equations).
*** Unit IV - Final Review
Still ongoing.
** 18.06sc (Linear Algebra)
Textbook arriving soon.
* bwmse
** Continuing updates resulting from 18.03 review
* wood chips
No progress. Rainy...
* SCZ Front Step
No progress. Rainy...
* SCZ Garbage Disposal Replacement
done
* SCZ "China Cup Candle" glue job.
Interesting how a FedEx driver packing job and FexEx shipment resulted
in broken china.
* Various i686
*** netbsd
installed.
*** buildroot
builds complete.
* piper
** dovecot
*** Raising apparmor error.
Not sure how to resolve.
** pidgeonhole
*** procmail replacement.
*** Considering integration.
** httpd
*** Still stable.
** SSL cert
Trying letsencrypt with certbot. http problem above may be interfering.
** redmine
Still not sure I want to go down this rabbit hole.
** openvpn
Need to consider cert construction.
* Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH
** Update
Sometime next year.
* SJC weather station
** Still having wireless connectivity problems
Need 20m cable.
** Really *Really* should put CPU in a proper enclosure
* cipher-puzzle
** more fixes and tweaks
* opencl
** Studying. Have some examples working.
** Need to look at arrayfire as an alternative.
** This is a bit of a hammer looking for a nail.
* EPLDH
** MPFI interval arithmetic better alternative
* wktpqb
** needs a new approach
** Verifying edge construction (con't.)
** 'gcd' algorithm doesn't work
* Compilers
** Started extracting C++ standard grammar
*** Interesting how the grammar is not completely formal.
*** Extracting from latex sources.
** Started hand written WSN parser
* Mill Controller #2
** Mounted on mill - ready or testing
** Need to investigate new HW/SW for eventual replacements
*** Old crap ain't gonna last forever
*** Buildroot/Linux 5.15 PREEMPT + latency tools
First pass done - boots on real hardware
** Alternative architecture
*** Split off stepper motor controller to separate board
Increase latency tolerance on controller
*** Use emc2 MODBUS/TCP protocol for stepper and other IO
* Alum Rock Data Center
** Need a VPS with static IP
*** OpenVPN to tie it all together
*** Gandi VPS datacenter in France so connection crosses international border
What are the data security and privacy tradeoffs?
*** Prototype VPS on existing hardware
**** OpenStack?
* CA Root Key Generation
Nice to have an appliance that manages keys.
Need to make this simple. Really don't have time for a science project.
Could just buy something from nitrokey https://www.nitrokey.com/
But I really don't want to spend money on it of I have hardware already.
** Need to be clear on security properties.
Definitely protect against remote access to private keys. How strong
does the protection against *local* access need to be?
** Simple hardware.
*** Use some modern device TPM
Need to export data for backup.
*** Or something that uses PKCS11 interface
** USB Serial interface only but no credentials across USB I/F.
But this potentially exposes the hardware to remote access via the USB
I/F when connected.
** Use Sneakernet
Doesn't scale. Should use something so cert updates are automatable.
But that's a science project it seems.
* Virtual Orchestra
** sfz file tests
*** need tooling to edit sample files
** increasingly skeptical whether quality results are possible
** maybe should treat as platform for concatinative synthesis
** maybe should just accept the limitations and work with it
One should not be disappointed that a guitar can't sound like a flute.
* gat
** spectrogram done - matches 'octave' output
* RIOT drivers
Implemented - needs testing.
** WS2801
** Velleman KA03
** Velleman KA05
* mcd05 32 button/led box
** Recovered schematics.
** Planning software.
** Received STM32F767 Nucleo144 with Ethernet.
*** Test program running.
*** Need to consider CoAP multicast discovery.
*** Consider simpler architecture with STM32F767 as a 'hub'.
*** Consider CAN interface to hub.
* AMD 2900 bitslice computing
** Probably my oldest uncompleted project
** Exploring possibilities for something constructive
Create verilog models for 2903/2910 and verify against hardware?
* Hitachi HD68B09E CPU
** RAM/UART/IO
** Started schematic
*** Standard peripheral set for 8 bit CPU bringups
Board schematic planned - need Kicad symbols
** Arduino Mega 2560 DMA loader
...Along with standard 8 bit loader
** Generate quadrature clock directly
** Full Bus SW Emulation infeasible
6809 1000ns maximum cycle time too short
* Rockwell R65F11
** Still evaluating.
** Dev board
Reverse engineered some of a mostly fully built development board with
one part missing. As near as I can tell, that one part is some sort of
programmable address decoder with a pinout that does not correspond to
any part I can find. Kind of like a GAL but with inputs on top and
outputs on bottom (as opposed to left and right in a standard GAL). I
have no idea what the provenance of this board is and if it ever
worked.
* PLD programming
Looks like Atmel 16V8 is the last 5V PLD part left standing. Maybe not
surprising that there still doesn't appear to be a fully open source
tool chain for programming. How hard could it be? (!) Could next-pnr
generic help? Might be easier to use espresso for logic array and program
output logic bits directly for simple stuff.
* EPROM Programming
Found some software for Needham programmer. Need to check electrolytic
caps on ISA board.
* POSIT
** Use POSITs for YRX?
No. Existing library is fine.
* MAME
** Subset builds in debug mode
Full debug fails - not enough disk or memory.
** gs6809 serial IO doesn't work right with PTY and other streams
** ampro (Z80/Z80SIO) *does* work with PTY
** Evaluating what is needed for other emulators.
* More project ideas
** Zuse Z3 simulation in Verilog
   Good excuse for floating point ALU design. Try posit format?
** GMPForth ports to simulators
*** SIMH for some targets (vax)
*** MAME looks interesting for microprocessor system emulations
    How to support ersatz systems?
*** Ports to classic figFORTH targets
** GMPASM assembler
   May be useful for handbuilt and rare systems (DMX1000?).
** Extracting ISO Superboard Forth ROMS for MAME emulation
** 'bwocl' OpenCL tooling
*** Offline compilation
*** Standard Kernel Running
** hardware support for classic 5V CPUs
*** RTX2000, CDP1802 still available!
*** 6502, 68000, 320C30, others on hand
*** CPUs with totally async bus may be supportable without RAM
*** Could use small footprint monitor in asm (gmpmon?)
** Existing 'retro' hardware still working?
*** OSI Superboard
Unknown. Composite to VGA adapter didn't seem to work. Needs analysis.
Found OSI model 610 board underneath!
*** Super Jolt
No output. Needs analysis.
*** Ampro Little Board
Not booting. Needs analysis.
*** Rockwell R65F11 Demo board
UART sending "NO ROM" at 2400 7N1 as expected with 2MHz xtal.
MAME emulator possibilities?
*** NMIX-0016
Works. Found original prom in a parts stash(!).
* David Davies
** Broadcom BCG? Employee indicted for running a brothel.
** New case C1923172, consolidated with *15* Parties.
** Next hearing 2/26/2024
