Now I don't know what to say... election edition

* Live Oak Weather Station

Prepared new mast mount with 2" angle iron.

Started integrating sensors with weewx.

* Swocer

3D prints of "perf board" for crystal radio resulted in a 12 hour
print run for a 4" x 4" square. Abandoned. Need to see if this can
be done in less than two hours.

* Mahogany Napkin holder

...with dovetails! Design complete; material cut to size.

* Watercolor

Still studying palette stuff. "Daniel Smith" has a spreadsheet of
CIELAB color data for their paints, so am considering a WebGL
visualization of the CIELAB data using three.js

* Neighborhood fence building

A neighbor up the street on Koopmans is putting up a nice redwood
fence, so I volunteered to help out.
