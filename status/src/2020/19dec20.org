Third Week of Advent

* Santa Cruz Weather Station
** /dev/ttyUSB0 not found after reboot
https://github.com/daniel-kelley/sczwx/issues/2
Fixed. What a pain. Thought it could be fixed using systemd init,
but landed up with a wait loop in the serial port open.
** Add forecast link
https://github.com/daniel-kelley/sczwx/issues/5
Something simple! Added a link to NWS forecast.
* Github
Finally converted development repositories to SSH.
* EPICS
Mostly worked out SCPI command structure for U3HV for all commands.
* Santa's Workshop
** Oak Napkin holder
Pieces done. Dovetails laid out and cut.
** Low Angle Block Plane Drawing
Trish needed a line drawing of a low angle block plane
