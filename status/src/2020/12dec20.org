Second Week of Advent

* Waffle Trivet
Done.

* AVB networking

Concluded (again) that for my purposes AES3id if a better fit for
distributed audio synchronization than 802.1AV.

* Datasheet template

Some breakage (perhaps) after upgrading to Fedora 33:

Not completely fixed, as latex processing gets stuck in a loop when
using the Stix math font.

* Santa's Workshop

** Three sided coin

With tests!

** Oak Napkin holder

Going to try dovetails for real.

* Alum Rock Data Center

Redhat announces that CentOS 8 will convert to CentOS streams at the
end of the year. Thank you IBM!

I *was* planning on moving to CentOS 8, so now I'll stick with CentOS 7
and see what the fallout will be.

Looks like my squirrelmail days are numbered, so will likely move to
roundcube/sqlite.

Finally got Kiki's SSH key on piper.
